# Mental Health Awareness

## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this project, Mental Health Awareness, is to create an easy to naviagte and appealing website to create a positive user experience which in turn will make it as easy as possible for everyone, espeically beginners, to access information on mental health, recognising common issues and manage stress.

**Guidance:** Begin filling out this section during Phase 1: Ideation & Initial Setup. Clearly articulate the main goal of your project, what it aims to achieve, and how it will provide value to your target audience.

### Target Audience
The main target for this website will be people who are first looking into mental health, however it will also include useful and imporant links for all kinds of users to access information on mental health. Having an easy to navigate, simple but effective layout and colour pallet to draw users in and make it easier to learn about the subjects present on the website. The easy to navigate and attractive layout will encourage users to stay on the page and therefore encourage users to learn more.

## Design Decisions

### Wireframes
Include wireframes for key sections of your website.  
Briefly describe the design choices, including layout, colour schemes, and fonts.  
**Guidance:** Start this section during Phase 1: Ideation & Initial Setup and update it throughout Phase 2 and Phase 3. Include digital wireframes created in Phase 1. Document the reasoning behind your layout choices, colour schemes, and font selections.

Using mind.org.uk for ideas on colour and layout I used dev tools to obtain one of the colours which I added to a colour pallet created by coolors.com : #fecb4e. A quick google search gave me an idea of what colours are associated with good mental health and positivity. With this guide I asked ChatGPT to adjust my colour pallet so the colours would work better with each other. This resulted in these colours: Persian orange, Tomato, Rebecca purple, Xanthous, Bleu de France.
